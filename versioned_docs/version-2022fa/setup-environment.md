## Install Node.js

Go to [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions.

For consistency, we will use Node LTS (currently, as of Spring 2022, this is Node 16).

## Install Yarn

For convenience, we assume you will use Yarn instead of npm. However, you can use either for the purposes of this project.

Go to [this website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) and follow the instructions.

## Install ts-node to run ts files

```zsh
 npm install -g ts-node
```
Then to run a file `file.ts`

```zsh
ts-node file.ts
```
