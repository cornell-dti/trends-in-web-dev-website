## Install Node.js

Go to [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions.

For consistency, we will use Node LTS (currently, as of Spring 2021, this is Node 14).

## Install Yarn

For convenience, we assume you will use Yarn instead of npm. Yarn gives us the
power to create **workspaces**, which we will discuss in detail later.

Go to [this website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) and follow the instructions.
