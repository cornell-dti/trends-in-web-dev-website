## Install Node.js

Go to [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions.

For consistency, we will use Node LTS (currently, as of Spring 2023, this is Node 18).

After installing, you should be able to run `node` in your terminal and get a command-line interface to execute JavaScript code, line-by-line.

## Install Yarn

For convenience, we assume you will use Yarn instead of npm. However, you can use either for the purposes of this project.

Go to [this website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) and follow the instructions.
