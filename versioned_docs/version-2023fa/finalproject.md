title: Final Project
---

This semester, we've learned some great tools for web development. Now, we will
put them all together to make an amazing final project!

## Outline

TBA

## Requirements

TBA

## Suggested Project Ideas

- Picnic items
- Clicker game (more involved)
- Blog
- Forum
- Wiki
- Songs browsing website
- Social network
- School management DB

You are not limited to these ideas, they are just some things
we've seen in the past that might help you get started!

## Milestones

The project will be divided into a number of milestones to help you progress in
a reasonable way.

Your remaining slip days are still valid for this. The group's allotted slip days is the max of your group members'. **You are allowed to use at most 3 slip days per each of Milestones 1, 2, 3.**

### Team Matching Form

#### Due: TBA by 11:59 PM (no slip days)

Please fill out [TBA] by **TBA**. This is a hard deadline because we want to assign group members the same day so you have enough time to work on Milestone 1.

### Milestone 1

**Due: TBA by 11:59 PM**

**Steps**

**Submission**

### Milestone 2

**Due: TBA by 11:59 PM**

### Milestone 3

**Due: TBA by 11:59 PM**

### Final Project

**Due: TBA by 11:59 PM**

This is the last milestone!

Finish up the authentication system on your site and deploy your website.

Need help? Come to [office hours](/docs/2023sp/introduction) and we can help you debug. Also feel free to post questions on Ed!

:::danger
Do not push private API keys, Firebase service accounts, or other sensitive information to GitHub. Similarly, do not push `node_modules` up to GitHub. If we see these in your GitHub, you **will** lose points.

Note that firebase configs for the frontend are fine (and **should be**) included in your submission.

Submit a zip file of your project to CMSX by the deadline!

## Optional Extensions

If you're looking for an added challenge, consider doing one or more of these extensions! There is no extra credit for these extensions, but it will really enrich your understanding of webdev (and make us very impressed!)

1. Make your website mobile-friendly/responsive to different screen sizes. You can get started using Media Queries and Clamping in CSS.
2. Use an external API (in additional to your Firebase backend!). For instance, you could use the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to pull in song data, or the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to pull in weather data.
3. Implement testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and/or the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/).
4. If you're a CS 3110 student, use a [TypeScript Pattern-Matching Library](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) to go further with functional programming in your frontend.

## Grading

This is subject to change. TBA!

- Frontend (35%)

  - Use of ES6 & TypeScript
  - Component structure
  - Use of hooks
  - Functional programming

- Database/Backend (15%)

  - Data fetching
  - Data insertion
  - Data deletion

- Auth (10%)

  - Authentication (using Firebase auth)

- Styling (5%)

- Deployment (5%)

- Code style and file structure (5%)

- Effort (25%)
  - This may seem like an arbitrary measure, but we expect most people to
    get most of the points here; the only way to lose points is if it is
    clear that not a lot of effort has been put in or you are consistently
    missing milestones.

## Tips for Success!

- Get in contact with your partner early! _Better initial planning means less frustrations later on._
- Be realistic. We know you are ambitious, but also understand your own capabilities, and avoid changing ideas halfway through.
- Use git.
  - It is great for sharing code between you and your partner/team members. _Please_ don't just email code back and forth.
  - Use git branches!
    - When developing a feature, you should open up a new GitHub branch rather than committing and pushing directly to the main branch. This will allow you to develop your feature independently of the current state of main (and what your partners are doing) and only merge in when you are sure your feature is done and works.
    - Branches can also protect you from weird frustrating merge conflicts (so you can focus on developing awesome features!)
- Pair programming is fun!
  - Ideally, you should both be actively involved in the whole development process. A good way to achieve this is to step up a time to [pair program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) and code together!
