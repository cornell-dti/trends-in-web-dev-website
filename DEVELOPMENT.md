# Website

This website is built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator.

## Setup

### Installation

```bash
yarn
```

### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

## Style Guide

Please keep the 80-character size limit so that the rendered webpage won't have
ugly line wraps. `.editorconfig` and `.vscode/settings.json` help to ensure
that.

## Deployment

Deployment is automatically handled by GitHub actions.
