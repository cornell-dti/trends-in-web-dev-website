## Install Node.js

Go to [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions.

For consistency, we will use Node version newer than LTS.

## Install Yarn

For convenience, we assume you will use Yarn instead of npm.

Go to [this website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and follow the instructions.
